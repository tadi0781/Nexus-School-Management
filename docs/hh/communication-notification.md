You are absolutely right to point that out. My apologies. I misinterpreted the `CHAT_PERMISSIONS` logic for students. I have re-analyzed the configuration in your code, and you are correct: students cannot initiate chats with teachers, but they can chat with other students who are also Talent Club members.

Thank you for the correction. I will restart this segment with the accurate logic.

### Feature Deep Dive: Direct Communication & Notifications ðŸ’¬

This system is the school's private and secure internal messaging network. It allows for instant, one-on-one conversations and ensures important alerts are delivered directly to the right people, all within the safety of the Nexus platform.

#### Private Chat (One-to-One Conversations)

This is like a secure, internal version of WhatsApp or Telegram, designed specifically for school communication, with very clear rules about who can talk to whom.

*   **The Contacts List ðŸ“–**
    *   Each user has a personal contacts list. This is not a public phone book; it is a **smart list** showing only the people they are *allowed* to chat with based on their role and the rules set by the administration.
    *   This list is organized neatly by role (Staff, Teachers) and by class, making it easy to find the right person.

*   **Who Can Chat with Whom? (The Rules)**
    *   The entire chat system is governed by a **powerful permissions matrix**. This set of rules dictates exactly who can start a conversation.
    *   **Teachers, Librarians, and Admins** can generally start chats with each other and with parents.
    *   **Students** have specific rules:
        *   By default, a student **cannot** start a chat with a teacher. This ensures that official communication channels are used.
        *   However, students who are **Talent Club Members** are granted the special ability to chat with other Talent Club students. This fosters collaboration and community within that group.
    *   **Parents** can initiate chats with teachers and other staff, but not directly with students other than their own children (if that feature is enabled).

*   **Real-Time Messaging âš¡**
    *   When you open a chat with someone, the conversation happens in real-time.
    *   New messages appear on the screen instantly without needing to refresh the page.
    *   The system shows when the other person has **seen your message** by marking it as "read."

*   **Unread Message Counter**
    *   A red badge ðŸ”´ with a number appears at the top of the screen, showing a user exactly how many new, unread chat messages are waiting for them. This counter updates automatically.

*   **File Sharing in Chat ðŸ“Ž**
    *   Users can attach and send files (like documents, images, or PDFs) directly within a private chat, making it easy to share resources one-on-one.

#### The Notification System (Important Alerts ðŸ””)

This is the school's official announcement system, ensuring that critical updates and alerts are never missed.

*   **Centralized Notification Inbox**
    *   Every user has a personal notification inbox, accessible from anywhere in the application.
    *   Like the chat system, a red badge ðŸ”´ shows the count of unread notifications.

*   **Automated System Alerts**
    *   The system automatically sends notifications for important events:
        *   When you are assigned a new **task**.
        *   When an asset you submitted is **approved**.
        *   When a maintenance report you filed is **resolved**.
        *   When you receive an invitation to join a **Talent Club proposal**.
        *   When a new **behavior record** is added for you or your child.

*   **Direct Message Composition**
    *   Administrators and teachers have the ability to compose and send custom notifications to individuals, entire roles (e.g., "all parents"), or specific groups (e.g., "all Grade 11 students").
    *   They use an intelligent recipient selector to easily find and target the correct audience for their message.

*   **Actionable Links**
    *   Most notifications contain a direct link. Clicking the notification takes the user straight to the relevant pageâ€”for example, to the specific task they need to work on, or to the asset report that was just updated. This saves time and makes it easy to take action.

*   **Managing Notifications**
    *   Users can mark individual notifications as read.
    *   They also have a "Mark All as Read" button to easily clear their inbox.
