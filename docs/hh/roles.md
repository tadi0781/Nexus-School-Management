Perfect. Let's move on to the next segment, which covers the roles and the personalized dashboards that form the core of the user experience.

### Feature Deep Dive: Core Navigation & Role-Based Dashboards 🏠

Think of our Nexus platform as a large, specialized school building. Not everyone has a key to every room. A student's key opens different doors than a teacher's key, and an administrator's key opens almost all of them. This system defines each person's **role** and gives them a personal **home base (dashboard)** tailored exactly to their needs.

#### The Roles: Defining What You Can Do

Every user in the system is assigned a specific role. This role determines what features they can access, what information they can see, and what actions they can perform.

*   **System Administrator (`system_admin`):** The master key holder 🔑. They have the highest level of access to manage the entire application, including user accounts, system settings, and all other features.

*   **HR & Academic CEO (`hr_ceo`):** A top-level manager. They oversee user management, approve assets and reports, manage school-wide announcements, review requests, and have a high-level view of all school operations.

*   **School Executive (`school_executive`):** A board member or high-level supervisor. They can view school-wide data, see reports, and participate in the higher tiers of the formal request system.

*   **Government (`government`):** An external compliance officer. Their role is focused on viewing reports and participating in the final tier of the formal request system to ensure compliance.

*   **Teacher (`teacher`):** The academic staff. Their access is focused on classroom management: entering student marks, taking attendance, viewing their students' profiles, and managing equipment in their assigned lab.

*   **Librarian (`librarian`):** The manager of the library. They oversee the book checkout system, manage library inventory, and run the student attendance kiosk for the library.

*   **Parent (`parent`):** A guardian linked to one or more students. They can view their children's progress, including grades, attendance, and behavior records, and can communicate with teachers.

*   **Talent Club (`talent_club`):** This is a special role, not for students themselves, but for **coordinators or leaders** appointed to manage the overall Talent Club system. The system-wide TC Leader, for example, has this role.

*   **Student (`student`):** The core user of the academic system. They can view their grades, attendance, and assigned tasks. Students with special talents and passions can choose to become **Talent Club Members**, which unlocks a whole new world of social and collaborative features. A student can also be promoted to a **Student Leader**, giving them extra responsibilities like managing assets for their classroom.

#### The Dashboard: Your Personal Home Base

When you log in, the system instantly directs you to your dashboard. This is not a generic welcome page; it's a dynamic, personalized home base that shows you exactly what you need to know.

*   **For a Student 🧑‍🎓:** The dashboard is their academic hub. It shows their upcoming tasks, a summary of their borrowed books, recent grades, and a list of their teachers. From here, they can also choose to join the Talent Club.

*   **For a Teacher 🧑‍🏫:** The dashboard is their command center. It lists the classes they teach, the total number of students they manage, and provides quick links to enter marks or take attendance for each class.

*   **For a Librarian 📚:** The dashboard is the library kiosk. It features the system for checking students in and out of the library, alongside key stats like the number of books checked out and any overdue items.

*   **For an Administrator (HR/CEO) 🧑‍💼:** The dashboard is a high-level overview of the entire school. It shows key statistics like the number of pending assets for review, open maintenance reports, and new requests that require their attention.

This tailored experience ensures that every user, no matter their role, has immediate access to the tools and information most relevant to their responsibilities, making the entire platform efficient and easy to navigate.
