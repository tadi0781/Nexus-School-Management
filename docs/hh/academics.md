#### For Teachers: The Digital Grade Book & Classroom Tools

This system empowers teachers with efficient tools to manage their classes, freeing them up to focus on teaching.

*   **My Classroom Hub**
    *   The teacher's dashboard displays a clean, organized list of every class they are assigned to (e.g., "Grade 10, Section A - Mathematics").
    *   This hub is the starting point for all their academic tasks.

*   **Entering Student Marks üìù**
    *   Teachers can select any of their classes to open a digital marks sheet.
    *   Here, they can easily enter scores for each student for different semesters or terms.
    *   **Smart Calculation:** As soon as scores are entered, the system automatically calculates the `Total` and `Average` for each student, saving the teacher from manual calculations and reducing errors.
    *   **Automatic Ranking üèÜ:** After marks are saved, the system instantly calculates and assigns a `Rank` to every student in that class based on their average score. This handles ties correctly and provides immediate feedback on class performance.

*   **Taking Attendance**
    *   Teachers can take daily attendance for their classes with just a few clicks.
    *   They are presented with a list of their students and can mark each one as `Present`, `Late`, or `Excused`, with an option to add short notes if needed.
    *   **The Attendance Grid:** For a broader view, teachers can see a full monthly grid for their class. This color-coded calendar shows at a glance who was present or absent on any given day of the month, making it easy to spot attendance patterns.

#### For Students: Your Personal Academic Dashboard

Students are given a clear and up-to-date view of their own academic journey.

*   **Viewing Your Grades**
    *   On their dashboard, a student can see a complete list of all their subjects.
    *   Next to each subject, they can see their scores, the calculated average, and their current rank in the class. This provides instant, transparent feedback on their performance.

*   **Tracking Your Attendance**
    *   Students can see their own attendance record, allowing them to keep track of their presence and punctuality.

*   **Viewing Student Profiles**
    *   The system includes a detailed profile page for each student.
    *   A teacher can view the profile of any student in their class, which shows a complete overview of that student's marks, attendance history, and behavior records, all in one place.

#### For Parents: A Window into Your Child's Progress

*   Parents who are linked to their children in the system can view their child's academic information.
*   They can see their child's marks in every subject, their attendance records, and any behavior notes, keeping them informed and involved in their child's education.

#### For Administrators: School-Wide Oversight

*   High-level administrators (like the HR/CEO) have access to a **"Student Database."**
    *   This is not just a list; it‚Äôs an organized directory of all students, grouped by grade and section.
    *   From here, administrators can view class lists, check overall enrollment, and export class data to a CSV file for official reporting or analysis. This provides a powerful, top-down view of the entire student body.
