Of course. Here is the next segment, explaining the **User Settings & Profile Management** features.

### Feature Deep Dive: User Settings & Profile Management ‚öôÔ∏è

This is every user's personal control panel. It's a central, private space where they can manage their identity, update their information, and customize their experience on the Nexus platform.

#### The Universal Settings Page

Every user, regardless of their role, has access to a "Settings" page. This page is divided into logical sections to make it easy to manage their account.

*   **Profile Information**
    *   This is where users manage their public-facing identity. They can update:
        *   Their **Full Name**.
        *   Their unique **Username**.
        *   Their contact **Email Address**.
        *   Other personal details like `Age` and `Gender`.

*   **Profile Photo Upload üñºÔ∏è**
    *   Users can upload a personal profile photo.
    *   The system includes a modern, easy-to-use tool for uploading images.
    *   When a new photo is uploaded, it automatically replaces the old one. The system also intelligently cleans up the old, unused image file from the server to save space.

*   **Password Management**
    *   This section provides a secure form for users to change their own password.
    *   As a security measure, they must always enter their **current password** correctly before they can set a new one.

#### Role-Specific Information (Display Only)

The settings page also shows important information that is set by administrators and cannot be changed by the user. This provides clarity about their status in the system.

*   **Your Role:** Displays their official role (e.g., `Teacher`, `Student`).
*   **Talent Club Status:** Shows a simple "Yes" or "No" to indicate if they are currently an active TC Member.
*   **Student Leader Status:** Shows if they have been designated as a Student Leader.

#### Account Preferences (Future-Ready)

The settings page is built to accommodate future preferences to give users more control over their experience.

*   **Profile Visibility**
    *   A setting is included that will allow users to control who can see their full profile page (e.g., `Everyone`, `Teachers Only`, `Private`).

*   **Data & Analytics**
    *   The system includes placeholder toggles for data privacy settings, such as allowing the collection of anonymous usage data for improving the platform.

#### How It Works: Smart & Secure

*   **Pre-filled Forms:** When a user goes to their settings page, all the forms are automatically pre-filled with their current information, making it easy to see what's on record and change only what's necessary.
*   **Secure Validation:** The system performs checks to ensure that a new username or email address isn't already being used by another account, preventing conflicts.
*   **One Central Location:** By putting all these options in one place, the system ensures users always know where to go to manage their account, creating a simple and predictable user experience.
