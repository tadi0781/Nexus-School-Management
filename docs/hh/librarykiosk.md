    *   When a student leaves, the librarian clicks a "Check Out" button next to their name.
    *   The system logs their departure time and automatically calculates the total duration of their visit in minutes.

*   **Daily History & Leaderboards**
    *   The librarian can view a complete history of all student visits for any given day.
    *   The system also generates a **leaderboard**, showcasing which students have visited the library most frequently over different time periods (e.g., this month, this year). This is a great tool for encouraging library use.
