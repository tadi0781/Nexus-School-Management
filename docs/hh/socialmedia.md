Excellent. I'm glad that level of detail and structure is what you're looking for.

Here is the next segment, explaining the **Social Media & Community Engagement** features.

***

### Feature Deep Dive: Social Media & Community Engagement üåê

This is the social heart of the Nexus platform. It's designed to build community, encourage collaboration, and give users a space to share ideas and content. It's like having our own private, school-focused social network with different levels of privacy and interaction.

#### The Global Feed ("Nexus Pulse") üì∞

This is the main community timeline, visible to all users. It's like the central town square of our digital school.

*   **Create a Post**
    *   Any user can create a post on the global feed.
    *   They can write text, upload a single file (like a photo, document, or video), or do both.
    *   Posts appear instantly for everyone to see.

*   **Real-Time Interactions ‚ö°**
    *   When a new post, comment, or "like" happens, the feed updates **live** for everyone currently viewing it, without needing a page refresh. This is powered by our Socket.IO engine.
    *   Users can "like" posts to show their appreciation.
    *   Users can write comments on posts, and even reply to other comments, creating threaded discussions.

*   **Secure & Controlled**
    *   A user can only edit or delete their own posts and comments.
    *   Administrators have the ability to moderate the feed by deleting any post or comment to maintain a safe and positive environment.

#### Channels: Your Personal Broadcast Station üì¢

Channels are designed for one-way communication, like a personal blog, a department newsletter, or a subject-specific announcement board.

*   **Creation & Ownership**
    *   Authorized users (like teachers or administrators) can create their own channels.
    *   When creating a channel, the owner gives it a name, a description, and can set it to be either **Public** (anyone can see and subscribe) or **Private** (only approved members can see).

*   **Subscribers & Roles**
    *   Users can "subscribe" to public channels to get their updates.
    *   The channel owner can promote trusted subscribers to the role of **"Admin,"** giving them permission to post content on the owner's behalf.

*   **Posting Content**
    *   Only the owner and admins of a channel can post content. This makes channels a perfect tool for official announcements where a discussion is not the primary goal.
    *   Like the global feed, posts can contain text and file attachments.

#### Groups: Your Private Collaboration Space ü§ù

Groups are designed for two-way communication and collaboration among a specific set of members. They are like a private chat room for a project, a study group, or a small team.

*   **Creation & Membership**
    *   Any user can create a new group. The creator automatically becomes the **"Owner."**
    *   The owner can then invite other users to become members.
    *   The owner can also promote members to the **"Admin"** role, allowing them to help manage the group and its members.

*   **Group Chat**
    *   **All members** of a group can send messages, creating a dynamic, real-time conversation.
    *   The chat interface is similar to the one-on-one chat, with messages appearing instantly for all online group members.
    *   Members can also share files within the group chat.

*   **Group Management**
    *   The group owner and admins have a dedicated management page where they can:
        *   Edit the group's name and description.
        *   Change the group's profile photo.
        *   Add or remove members.
        *   Promote or demote members between the "Member" and "Admin" roles.
        *   "Archive" the group, which deactivates it and hides it from view without permanently deleting it.
