Of course. Here is the next segment, explaining the **Analytics & Reporting** features.

### Feature Deep Dive: Analytics & Reporting üìä

This system is the school's **high-level dashboard and data analysis tool**. It‚Äôs designed for administrators (like the HR/CEO and School Executives) to get a clear, "big picture" view of the school's performance and key metrics. It transforms the day-to-day data collected by the platform into simple charts, graphs, and exportable reports.

#### The Analytics Dashboard

This is a central page where administrators can see visual summaries of important school data at a glance.

*   **Live Data Visualization**
    *   The dashboard features several charts that are generated from **live school data**.
    *   This is not static information; it reflects the current state of the school.

*   **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
    *   The dashboard is designed to answer important questions quickly:
        *   **Daily Attendance Summary:** A pie chart instantly shows how many students were `Present`, `Late`, `Excused`, or `Absent` on any given day. This gives a real-time pulse on student attendance.
        *   **Academic Performance by Subject:** A bar chart displays the average academic score for each subject across the school. This makes it easy to see which subjects are excelling and which might need more support.
        *   **Student Demographics:** A chart shows the breakdown of the student body by metrics like gender, providing a quick overview of the school's demographic makeup.
        *   **Enrollment & Graduation Trends:** Line and bar charts are prepared to show trends over time, such as the number of new student enrollments each month or graduation rates by year.

#### Data Exporting (The Digital Filing System üóÇÔ∏è)

Understanding that data is often needed for official reports, presentations, or further analysis, the system includes a powerful export feature.

*   **Export to CSV**
    *   Next to each chart or data summary on the analytics dashboard, there is an **"Export"** button.
    *   Clicking this button allows the administrator to download the raw data for that specific report as a **CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file**.

*   **Ready for Any Spreadsheet**
    *   CSV is a universal format that can be opened by any spreadsheet program, like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.
    *   This makes it incredibly easy for administrators to use the school's live data for creating official documents, financial reports, or their own custom charts and analyses.

*   **What Can Be Exported?**
    *   Administrators can export clean, organized data files for:
        *   The daily attendance summary.
        *   The subject-by-subject performance averages.
        *   The student demographic breakdown.
        *   Class lists from the student database.

This reporting system provides administrators with the crucial insights they need to make informed, data-driven decisions for the school.
