Of course. Here is the next segment, explaining the **Multi-Tiered Request System**.

### Feature Deep Dive: Multi-Tiered Request System ðŸ“¨

Think of this system as the school's official **formal letter and approval process**, digitized. It's designed for situations that require a documented, step-by-step review by different levels of authority. It ensures that important requestsâ€”like purchasing new equipment or reporting a major facility issueâ€”are properly tracked, escalated, and resolved with full accountability.

#### Initiating a Request (The Starting Point)

Not everyone can start a formal request. This is a privileged action for specific roles who are "on the ground" and can identify official needs.

*   **Who Can Submit?**
    *   Authorized users like a **Librarian**, **Teacher**, or a designated **Student Leader** can initiate a request.
    *   They fill out a formal request form, detailing the title, a full description, the type of request (e.g., `Purchase`, `Deficiency`), and its urgency.

*   **The First Stop: Tier 1**
    *   Every new request automatically goes to **Tier 1**, which is the **HR/CEO's** inbox.
    *   The system creates a permanent record of the request and notifies both the submitter (that their request was received) and the HR/CEO (that a new request is waiting for review).

#### The Approval Chain (The Escalation Ladder)

The request moves up a ladder of authority. A request cannot jump a level; it must be reviewed at each tier.

*   **Tier 1: HR/CEO Review**
    *   The HR/CEO reviews the request. They have several options:
        1.  **Resolve/Approve:** If it's something they can handle directly, they can mark it as `Resolved` or `Approved`, and the process ends.
        2.  **Deny:** They can deny the request, providing a reason. The process ends.
        3.  **Forward to Tier 2:** If the request requires higher approval, they forward it. The request then moves to the inbox of the **School Executive**.

*   **Tier 2: School Executive Review**
    *   The School Executive now sees the request in their inbox. They have the same set of options:
        1.  **Resolve/Approve:** Handle the request directly. The process ends.
        2.  **Deny:** Deny the request with a reason. The process ends.
        3.  **Forward to Tier 3:** If it requires the highest level of approval (e.g., for compliance or major budget items), they forward it. The request moves to the inbox of the **Government** officer.

*   **Tier 3: Government Officer Review**
    *   The Government officer is the final step. They review the request and can only **Approve** or **Deny** it. They cannot forward it any further.

#### Key Features of the System

This system is built for clarity and accountability.

*   **Dedicated Inboxes**
    *   Each manager in the approval chain (HR/CEO, School Executive, Government) has a personal **"Requests Inbox"** showing only the items that are waiting for *their* specific action.

*   **Complete History (The Digital Paper Trail) ðŸ“–**
    *   Every single action taken on a request is recorded in a permanent history log.
    *   This log shows:
        *   Who created the request and when.
        *   Who reviewed it at each stage.
        *   When it was forwarded from one person to the next.
        *   The final resolution and any notes added along the way.
    *   This creates perfect transparency and a clear record of the decision-making process.

*   **Automatic Notifications ðŸ””**
    *   The system keeps everyone involved up-to-date automatically:
        *   The **original requester** is notified every time the status of their request changes (e.g., `Approved`, `Forwarded`, `Denied`).
        *   A **manager** is notified the moment a new request lands in their inbox for review.
