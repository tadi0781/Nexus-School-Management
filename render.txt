Based on the comprehensive analysis, here is a unique, consolidated list of all files that require adjustments, grouped by their location and type.

### **Backend**
*   `app.py`
    *   This is the central backend file requiring the most widespread adjustments. Changes include: adding new routes (e.g., `system_admin_dashboard`); creating new API endpoints (e.g., `/api/analytics/log`, `/api/student-search`, `/api/library-attendance`, edit/delete APIs for social content); updating numerous existing routes to provide missing data (e.g., `permissions`, dashboard stats, request counts); updating WTForms (e.g., `LoginForm`, `AddAssetForm`, `BehaviorRecordForm`); modifying data models (e.g., `Asset`, `BehaviorRecord`, `Message`); and implementing new or expanded SocketIO events for real-time updates across multiple features (Chat, Social, Tasks, Requests, Talent Club).

### **JavaScript (`static/js/`)**
*   `app.js`
    *   Minor clarification needed for `initializeSocialHandlers()` to ensure all social features are initialized.
*   `chat.js`
    *   Implement real-time features (listeners for SocketIO events), typing indicators, and file attachment logic.
*   `main.js` or `utils.js`
    *   Define and implement global helper functions like `initializeAllFilePondInputs()` and the JS logic for the global file viewing modal.
*   `requests.js`
    *   Implement AJAX form submission handlers to replace standard POSTs for a smoother user experience.
*   `social.js`
    *   Major additions required. Implement missing handlers for the Global Feed (edit, share, save, load more comments), Channels (all dynamic interactions), and Groups (all dynamic interactions). Implement SocketIO room management (join/leave calls).
*   `talent_club.js`
    *   Implement dynamic content loading for club profile tabs, AJAX handlers for leader admin actions, and listeners for real-time SocketIO updates.
*   `tasks.js`
    *   Implement AJAX handlers for submitting task status updates and reviews from the detail page.

### **HTML Templates (`templates/`)**

#### **Global & Layouts**
*   `base.html`
    *   Add a `<script>` tag to set global JavaScript variables (e.g., `window.currentUserRole`).
