## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Project Vision & Objective

The modern educational landscape is characterized by a high degree of complexity, involving diverse stakeholders—students, teachers, parents, and administrators—each with unique information and communication needs. Traditional school management often relies on a disparate collection of tools, leading to data silos, inefficient workflows, and fragmented communication channels.

The **Nexus Integrated School System** is engineered to solve this fundamental problem.

**Project Objective:** To design, develop, and deploy a centralized, multi-tenant web platform that seamlessly integrates the academic, administrative, and social facets of a school environment.

**Project Vision:** To be the single source of truth and the primary interaction hub for all school stakeholders. Nexus aims to replace operational friction with a fluid, intuitive, and role-aware digital ecosystem, thereby enhancing efficiency, fostering community engagement, and providing actionable insights through data centralization.

### 1.2. Target Audience & User Roles

The Nexus System is architected around a sophisticated Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model. Each feature, view, and action is meticulously mapped to a specific user role, ensuring data security and a tailored user experience. The primary user roles are:

*   **Student:** The core academic user. The system provides access to dashboards, assignments (Tasks), borrowed library assets, behavior records, and the social/Talent Club ecosystem.
*   **Teacher:** Responsible for academic delivery. The system provides tools for managing student marks, taking attendance, and overseeing assigned lab equipment.
*   **Parent:** The guardian user, focused on monitoring student progress. The system provides views into their child's academic and behavioral records.
*   **Librarian:** Manages the school's literary and equipment assets, overseeing the entire book checkout and attendance-taking process.
*   **Talent Club (TC) Coordinator/Leader:** A specialized role, often a student or teacher, responsible for managing the extracurricular Talent Club ecosystem, including proposals, memberships, and events.
*   **HR & CEO (HR & Academics CEO):** A high-level administrative role with oversight of personnel, asset management, reporting, and the initial tier of the request approval system.
*   **School Executive:** A top-tier administrative role responsible for a higher level of request approval and system oversight.
*   **Government:** An external compliance or oversight role with specific, limited views into the system for reporting and compliance verification.
*   **System Administrator:** The superuser role responsible for system health, user management, and ultimate technical oversight.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1. Technology Stack

The technology stack was selected to prioritize rapid, robust development, maintainability, and a modern, interactive user experience.

*   **Backend:**
    *   **Python 3.12:** A high-level, mature language chosen for its readability, extensive standard library, and vast ecosystem of third-party packages.
    *   **Flask:** A lightweight and flexible WSGI micro-framework. Its minimalist core allows for a custom-tailored architecture, avoiding the bloat of larger frameworks while providing the tools necessary for a complex application.
    *   **SQLAlchemy:** The premier Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) for Python. It provides a powerful abstraction layer over the database, allowing developers to work with Python objects instead of raw SQL, while still offering the ability to drop to raw SQL for complex queries. This significantly improves development speed and reduces the risk of SQL injection vulnerabilities.

*   **Database:**
    *   **PostgreSQL:** A powerful, open-source object-relational database system known for its reliability, feature robustness, and proven performance under load.
    *   **Flask-Migrate & Alembic:** This toolchain provides a systematic and version-controlled approach to database schema changes. Every modification to the data model is captured in a migration script, allowing for easy database upgrades, downgrades, and replication across different environments.

*   **Frontend:**
    *   **Jinja2:** A modern and designer-friendly templating engine integrated with Flask. It enables a clean separation of logic and presentation, with powerful features like template inheritance, includes, and filters.
    *   **SASS (SCSS):** A professional-grade CSS extension language. The use of `style.scss` indicates a structured approach to styling, utilizing variables, nesting, and mixins for more maintainable and scalable CSS.
    *   **JavaScript (ES6+):** Vanilla JavaScript is used to power the client-side interactivity. The modular nature of the JS files (`chat.js`, `social.js`, `tasks.js`) indicates a modern approach, handling everything from AJAX calls to dynamic UI updates.

*   **Real-Time Simulation & Interactivity:**
    *   **AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML):** The system extensively uses `fetch` API calls to create a dynamic, single-page-application-like feel. This is most evident in the Chat, Notification, and Social Feed features, where data is polled from the server to update the UI without requiring a full page reload. This is a pragmatic choice that provides a real-time feel without the infrastructure complexity of WebSockets.
    *   **FilePond, Tom Select, SweetAlert2:** The integration of these best-in-class JavaScript libraries for file uploads, enhanced select boxes, and user notifications, respectively, demonstrates a commitment to a superior User Experience (UX).

### 2.2. Architectural Patterns

*   **Monolith with Modular Design:** Nexus is built as a monolithic application, meaning the entire codebase is deployed as a single unit. However, it is designed with a strong sense of logical modularity. The code is organized by feature (e.g., `requests`, `tasks`, `social`), which allows for clear separation of concerns and makes the system easier to maintain and scale. This pattern provides the development simplicity of a monolith while preparing the codebase for a potential future transition to microservices if required.

*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** This is the cornerstone of the Nexus security model. Access to every route (page) and action (e.g., creating a task, approving a request) is programmatically controlled by decorators (`@login_required`, `@role_required`) that verify the `current_user`'s role against a list of permitted roles. This ensures data integrity and that users only interact with the parts of the system relevant to their function. A detailed breakdown of the permission matrix will be provided in Phase C.

*   **Template Inheritance:** The frontend leverages Jinja2's inheritance model. A master `layout/base.html` template defines the entire page structure, including the header, navigation, and footer. Individual page templates (`student/dashboard.html`, `assets/add_asset.html`, etc.) then `extend` this base and override specific blocks (`content`, `page_title`), promoting code reuse and ensuring a consistent look and feel across the entire application.

### 2.3. Project Directory Structure

A high-level overview of the project's organization is essential for any developer.

*   `app.py`: The heart of the application. Contains the Flask app initialization, configuration, database models (SQLAlchemy), forms (WTForms), and all route definitions (view functions).
*   `static/`: Contains all static assets that are served directly to the client.
    *   `css/`: Compiled CSS files and source SASS files (`.scss`).
    *   `js/`: Modular JavaScript files, each corresponding to a major feature.
    *   `img/`, `fonts/`: Image and font assets.
    *   `uploads/`: The target directory for user-uploaded files, such as profile photos and social media attachments.
*   `templates/`: Contains all Jinja2 HTML templates, organized into subdirectories by feature/module.
    *   `layout/`: Core layout templates like `base.html`, `_navbar.html`, `_sidebar.html`.
    *   `partials/`: Reusable UI components (e.g., `_social_post_item.html`).
    *   `auth/`, `student/`, `hr_ceo/`, etc.: Templates specific to a feature or user role.
*   `migrations/`: Stores the Alembic database migration scripts, providing a version history of the database schema.
